Welcome to Derek Sneddon's and Melanie Lent's Almahack (Hacker's Almanack)! Here, we'll be creating a comprehensive handbook on all sorts of hacking techniques to help any aspiring ethical hackers (including ourselves) get better at hacking! This repo is only for legal and ethical use and we are not responsible for illicit activity that misuses this material.
